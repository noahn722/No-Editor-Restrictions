# No-Editor-Restrictions
Important note [I am not in any way related to No Editor Restrictions I simply upload the updated files to they work for FiveM latest builds]

No Editor Restriciton is a plugin for fivem that removes all restrictions within R* Editor meaning you can Zoom however long you want, go outside of that annoying red circle that limits your radius and take videos even when they are recorded in FPV. 

## Installation
- Simply drag and drop the files in the NoEditorRestrictions folder to your FiveM Plugin folder located at C:\Users\[youruser]\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app\plugins.

Open a issue if you need support with installation
